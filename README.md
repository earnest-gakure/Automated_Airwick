Project Overview                                                             
Automated Airwick with ESP32 and PIR Sensor                                                      
This project combines the power of an ESP32 microcontroller and a Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor to create an intelligent and automated air freshening system. The goal is to enhance user experience by triggering the Airwick dispenser only when the presence of someone in the toilet is detected.                                                                        

Features:                                                                                                                                                                                             
Motion Detection: The PIR sensor is utilized to detect human presence in the toilet area. When motion is detected, it signals the ESP32 to activate the Airwick dispenser .                       

ESP32 Control: The ESP32 microcontroller acts as the brain of the system, processing signals from the PIR sensor and controlling the operation of the Airwick dispenser.                             

Smart Timing: The system is programmed to dispense air freshener only when motion is detected, preventing unnecessary activation and conserving fragrance refill.                             

User-Friendly: Enhances user convenience by providing an automated and hands-free solution for air freshening.
